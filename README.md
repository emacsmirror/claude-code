# Claude Code Emacs

[![CI Tests](https://github.com/yuya373/claude-code-emacs/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yuya373/claude-code-emacs/actions/workflows/test.yml)

An Emacs package to run Claude Code within Emacs.

## TODO
### Use LSP diagnostics to make Claude Code work
- fix diagnostic
- explain diagnostic

Include information about the open file, surrounding code (Â±3 lines), and diagnostic information.

### File completion when inserting `@` in prompt files
Since Claude Code reads files with `@path/to/file`

### Register Emacs as an MCP server for Claude Code
#### Open files
Text selection functionality (startText, endText)
#### Get open buffers
File path, file name, whether active or not
#### Currently selected range
Selected text, start line, end line, start character, end character, file name
#### Diagnostic information
LSP workspace diagnostic information

### Custom commands
$ARGUMENTS can be used as placeholder

#### Project-specific commands
If `project-root/.claude/commands/optimize.md` exists, it can be executed from Claude as `/project:optimize`
With arguments: `/project:optimize 123`
#### User-specific commands
If `~/.claude/commands/optimize.md` exists, it can be executed from Claude as `/user:optimize`
With arguments: `/user:optimize 123`

## Starting Claude Code
`claude-code-emacs-run`

## Prompt Management Features
A `.claude-code-emacs.prompt.md` file is created in each project root.
The buffer is opened with `switch-to-buffer-other-window`.

### Key Bindings
- `C-c C-s`: Send the markdown section at point to Claude Code buffer
- `C-c C-r`: Send the selected region to Claude Code buffer
- `C-c C-o`: Open Claude Code session

## Transient Menus
### Main Menu
Display the main menu with `M-x claude-code-emacs-transient`

#### Quick Send Keys
- `1` or `y`: Send "1" (useful for "yes" responses)
- `2`: Send "2"
- `3`: Send "3"
- `g`: Send "commit"
- `e`: Send Escape
- `m`: Send Return

### Prompt Buffer Menu
In prompt buffers, display the menu with `C-c C-t` or `M-x claude-code-emacs-prompt-transient`

## Other Features
### Send Region
`claude-code-emacs-send-region` - Send the selected region or entire buffer to Claude Code

## Testing
### Running Tests
```bash
# Using Makefile
make test

# Or run directly
emacs -batch -l run-tests.el
```

### All Tasks (clean, compile, test)
```bash
make all
```
