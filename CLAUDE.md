This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an Emacs package that provides integration with Claude Code CLI. The package allows running Claude Code sessions within Emacs using vterm mode, with each project getting its own isolated session. Additionally, it includes an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables Claude Code to interact directly with the Emacs environment.

## Package Structure

The package is modularized into several components:
- **claude-code-emacs.el** - Main entry point
- **claude-code-emacs-core.el** - Core functionality, utilities, and session management
- **claude-code-emacs-buffer.el** - Buffer naming and string processing
- **claude-code-emacs-commands.el** - Command execution and slash commands
- **claude-code-emacs-ui.el** - Transient menu interfaces
- **claude-code-emacs-prompt.el** - Prompt file management and mode
- **claude-code-emacs-mcp.el** - MCP WebSocket client integration
- **claude-code-emacs-mcp-*.el** - MCP protocol implementation
- **claude-code-emacs-mcp-events.el** - Real-time event notifications

## Development Commands

- `mcp-server/src/tools/*.ts` - Individual MCP tool implementations

## Architecture

### Session Management
Each project gets its own Claude Code buffer named `*claude:<project-root>*`. Key components:
- `claude-code-emacs-buffer-name()` - Generates unique buffer names per project
- `claude-code-emacs-ensure-buffer()` - Ensures buffer exists before operations
- `claude-code-emacs-with-vterm-buffer` - Helper macro for buffer context operations
- `claude-code-emacs-run()` - Starts or switches to Claude Code session
- `claude-code-emacs-close()` - Closes the window showing Claude Code buffer
- `claude-code-emacs-quit()` - Terminates session and kills buffer

### String Chunking System
Long strings are split into 50-character chunks to avoid terminal input limitations:
- `claude-code-emacs-chunk-string()` - Core chunking function
- Automatic delays between chunks for reliability
- Transparent to the user

### Custom Commands Architecture
Two types of custom commands are supported:

1. **Project Commands** (`.claude/commands/*.md`)
   - Sent as `/project:command-name`
   - Functions: `claude-code-emacs-execute-custom-command`
   - Interactive selection: `claude-code-emacs-get-custom-commands()`
   
2. **Global Commands** (`~/.claude/commands/*.md`)
   - Sent as `/user:command-name`
   - Functions: `claude-code-emacs-execute-global-command`
   - Interactive selection: `claude-code-emacs-get-global-commands()`

Both support `$ARGUMENTS` placeholders with interactive prompting via `claude-code-emacs-prompt-for-arguments()`.

### Macro Pattern for Slash Commands
Simple commands use this macro:
```elisp
(claude-code-emacs-define-slash-command "name" "/command")
```
This generates functions like `claude-code-emacs-init` that send `/init`.

### File Path Completion System
The `@` symbol triggers project file completion:
- `claude-code-emacs-get-buffer-paths()` - Lists all open project files
- `claude-code-emacs-at-sign-complete()` - Interactive completion
- Project root is replaced with `@` for brevity
- Handles cases where `@` is already typed to avoid duplication

### Mode Architecture
- **`claude-code-emacs-vterm-mode`** - Minor mode for Claude Code vterm buffers
  - Parent: `vterm-mode`
  - Key bindings: Quick send commands, transient menu access
  - Auto-enabled when starting Claude Code session
- **`claude-code-emacs-prompt-mode`** - Major mode for `.claude-code-emacs.prompt.md` files
  - Parent: `markdown-mode`
  - Key bindings: Section/region sending, file completion
  - Auto-enabled for prompt files

### Transient Menu System
- Main menu: `claude-code-emacs-transient`
- Prompt menu: `claude-code-emacs-prompt-transient`
- Organized into logical groups with mnemonic key bindings

## Testing Strategy

Tests use mock implementations to avoid vterm dependencies:
- Mock vterm functions with `cl-letf`
- Test data flows rather than terminal interactions
- Integration tests verify complete workflows
- Each module has its own test file (`test-claude-code-emacs-*.el`)
- Run all tests: `make test` or `emacs -batch -l run-tests.el`
- Run specific test: `emacs -batch -l run-tests.el -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit 'pattern'`

## CI/CD
- GitHub Actions runs tests on push/PR
- Tests against Emacs 28.1, 29.1, and snapshot
- Special handling for vterm module compilation in CI

## Important Implementation Details

### Error Handling
- Always use `claude-code-emacs-ensure-buffer` before operations
- Check file existence before reading command files
- Validate arguments are non-empty when required

### Keybinding Conventions
- `C-c C-*` in prompt buffers for mode-specific commands
- Single letters in transient menus for quick access
- `y` as alias for `1` (yes responses)
- `@` triggers file path completion in prompt buffers

### Dependencies
- **Required**: projectile, vterm, transient, markdown-mode, websocket
- **Optional**: lsp-mode (for diagnostics and language ID configuration)

### Coding Standards
- Use lexical binding in all files
- Prefix all functions with `claude-code-emacs-`
- Use defcustom for user-configurable variables
- Document all public functions
- Add unit tests for new functionality

When modifying this package:
1. Add tests for new functionality
2. Use the established macro patterns for new commands
3. Maintain project isolation in buffer naming
4. Follow the chunking pattern for long strings
5. Update relevant documentation (README, CLAUDE.md)

## MCP Server

### Architecture
The MCP server provides a bridge between Claude Code and Emacs:
- WebSocket server on dynamic port for Emacs connection
- stdio interface for Claude Code MCP protocol
- Implements tools: getOpenBuffers, getCurrentSelection, getDiagnostics, getDefinition, findReferences, describeSymbol, diff tools (openDiff, openDiff3, openRevisionDiff, openCurrentChanges, applyPatch)
- Implements resources: buffer content, project info, diagnostics
- Per-project WebSocket connections for session isolation
- Real-time event notifications from Emacs to Claude Code

### How MCP Connection Works
1. Claude Code automatically starts the MCP server when you begin a session (no need to type `/mcp`)
2. MCP server starts and creates a WebSocket server on a dynamic port
3. MCP server calls `claude-code-emacs-mcp-register-port` via emacsclient
4. Emacs receives the port and establishes WebSocket connection
5. Connection is now ready for bidirectional communication

**Important**: Claude Code must be configured with the MCP server (see Setup section) for the features to work.

### Setup
Claude Code needs to be configured to use the MCP server:

1. First build the MCP server:
   ```bash
   make mcp-build
   ```

2. Configure Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add-json emacs '{
     "type": "stdio",
     "command": "node",
     "args": ["/path/to/claude-code-emacs/mcp-server/dist/index.js"]
   }'
   ```

3. The connection is activated automatically when you start Claude Code

### Logging
The MCP server logs to a file for debugging purposes:
- Log file location: `.claude-code-emacs-mcp.log` in project root
- Logs include timestamps, connection status, and request/response details
- Event notifications are logged with full parameters
- Useful for troubleshooting MCP integration issues
- Previous log location (`/tmp/claude-code-emacs-mcp.log`) is no longer used

### Development
When working on the MCP server:
1. Build with `make mcp-build`
2. Check logs for debugging: `tail -f .claude-code-emacs-mcp.log`
3. Test TypeScript code: `npm test --prefix mcp-server`
4. The server auto-starts when Claude Code requests MCP tools
5. For development with hot-reload: `make mcp-dev`

### MCP Communication Flow
1. Claude Code connects to MCP server via stdio
2. MCP server establishes WebSocket connection to Emacs (dynamic port)
3. MCP tools translate requests into Emacs Lisp commands
4. Results are sent back through the same chain
5. Real-time events flow from Emacs to Claude Code via notifications

### Connection Health Monitoring
The MCP connection includes automatic health monitoring:
- **Ping/Pong mechanism**: Emacs sends ping messages every 30 seconds (configurable via `claude-code-emacs-mcp-ping-interval`)
- **Timeout detection**: If no pong is received within 10 seconds (configurable via `claude-code-emacs-mcp-ping-timeout`), the connection is considered lost
- **Session persistence**: Each project maintains its own WebSocket connection for isolation

### Event Notification System
The MCP server supports real-time notifications from Emacs:

#### Architecture
- **Emacs side**: `claude-code-emacs-mcp-events.el` hooks into Emacs events
  - `buffer-list-update-hook`: Monitors buffer state changes
  - `after-change-functions`: Tracks buffer content modifications
  - `lsp-diagnostics-updated-hook`: Watches LSP diagnostic updates
- **Bridge layer**: EmacsBridge forwards notifications via WebSocket
  - `handleNotification()` processes incoming events from Emacs
  - `setNotificationHandler()` registers callback for event handling
- **MCP server**: Forwards notifications to Claude Code via stdio
  - Notifications are sent as JSON-RPC 2.0 notification messages
  - Method names follow the `emacs/` namespace convention

#### Event Types
- **Buffer list updates** (`emacs/bufferListUpdated`): Tracks when buffers are opened, closed, or modified
  - Includes buffer metadata: path, name, active/modified status
  - Filtered by project to prevent cross-project noise
- **Content changes** (`emacs/bufferContentModified`): Monitors file modifications with line-level granularity
  - Multiple changes are batched into a single notification per project
  - Format: `{ "changes": [{ "file": "...", "startLine": ..., "endLine": ..., "changeLength": ... }, ...] }`
  - Overlapping changes are automatically merged to reduce redundancy
- **Diagnostics updates** (`emacs/diagnosticsChanged`): Forwards LSP diagnostics changes as they occur
  - All file diagnostics for a project are sent in one notification
  - Format: `{ "files": [{ "file": "...", "diagnostics": [...] }, ...] }`
  - Severity levels are translated from LSP numeric codes to strings

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient debouncing**: Prevents excessive notifications during rapid changes
  - Configurable delays via `claude-code-emacs-mcp-events-*-delay` variables
  - Timers are cancelled and reset on each new event
- **Multi-project support**: Each project connection receives only relevant events
  - Project root is stored with change data to avoid repeated file operations
  - Hash table lookup ensures O(1) routing performance
- **Batch optimization**: Changes and diagnostics are grouped per project to reduce network overhead
  - Changes to the same file region are merged automatically
  - All diagnostics for a project are sent in a single notification

#### Implementation Details
- **Change tracking**: Uses alist to store pending changes with project root information
- **Timer management**: Separate timers for each event type to allow independent debouncing
- **Error resilience**: All event handlers use `condition-case` to prevent errors from disrupting Emacs
- **Hook management**: `claude-code-emacs-mcp-events-enable/disable` functions for runtime control

### Known Issues and Solutions
- **WebSocket 400 error**: Fixed by ensuring the WebSocket URL includes a leading slash (e.g., `ws://localhost:port/?session=...`)
- **Connection timing**: WebSocket connections are established asynchronously; the `on-open` callback is used to ensure proper initialization
- **Timer management**: Ping timers are properly cleaned up on disconnect to prevent resource leaks
